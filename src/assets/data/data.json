      "about": "🍨 Carnevali è una gelateria che ha saputo conquistare fama e successo oltre i confini della piccola Castelraimondo e della realtà di provincia, grazie agli sforzi e all’impegno quotidiano di persone semplici ma vere, che hanno creduto giorno dopo giorno in questa attività dando tutta la loro vita.\n\n🏛️ Storica Gelateria · Cioccolateria · Bar Castelraimondo\n\nDal 1958 la famiglia Carnevali delizia i palati di miriadi di clienti a Castelraimondo con un gelato artigianale unico nella zona, noto anche oltre la provincia di Macerata per qualità, gusto e freschezza.\n\n🍫 Gelateria, cioccolateria e produzione artigianale di altri dolci rendono Carnevali un luogo speciale per gli amanti del dolce. Primi in provincia ad acquistare e utilizzare un pastorizzatore, la gelateria ha saputo affinare negli anni la produzione, introducendo gusti nuovi e originali. Tra i prodotti ci sono affogati, cocktail, frullati, brioche, frappè e molto altro.\n\n🏆 Premi e Riconoscimenti\n\n- Affogato al liquore, al caffè, al cioccolato\n- 1973: Premio per la coppa originale “Fior di Loto”\n- 1971: Riconoscimento da parte di Stock per la creazione di una coppa gelato\n- Aquila d’Oro per i 40 anni di attività nel settore turistico e commerciale (Fenacom)\n\n📖 Storia\n\nLa famiglia Carnevali intraprende quest’avventura nel maggio del 1958, quando decide di scommettere su questa attività nonostante i sacrifici. Allievi del maestro Walter Lini di Firenze, i Carnevali acquisiscono le tecniche e i segreti del gelato artigianale. Lo stesso Lini più volte ha espresso soddisfazione per la qualità del gelato Carnevali.\n\n🍦 Cosa facciamo\n\nLa gelateria Carnevali è specializzata nella produzione di gelati artigianali all’interno del proprio laboratorio. Tra le specialità: gelato ai fichi, bacio, mandorlato, nocciola, panna cotta e zuppa inglese. Inoltre, affogati, frappè, frullati e cioccolato artigianale. Offre anche cocktail alcolici e analcolici, oltre a una sala da tè con svariate tipologie e aromi.\n\n⭐ Qualità inconfondibile\n\nLa filosofia Carnevali è semplice: qualità sempre al primo posto. Dalla selezione degli ingredienti — come le nocciole del Piemonte, genuine e di prima scelta — fino alla lavorazione accurata, tutto punta a garantire l’eccellenza.\n\n👨‍🍳 La preparazione del gelato\n\nLa lavorazione prevede fasi precise: realizzazione e raffreddamento del composto a 5°C, riposo, mantecatura, dosaggio e dolcificazione. Carnevali offre anche gelati senza zucchero e gelati per celiaci, mantenendo sempre lo stesso standard di qualità.",
